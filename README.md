## Advent of Code 2018 Solutions in Kotlin

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)]()

This repo is my personal attempt at solving the [Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com/2018) set of problems with the Kotlin programming language.

I am trying to solve these on the day they are posted with clear, idiomatic solutions. That means in some cases I will sacrifice performance for a more clear solution.
